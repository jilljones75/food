              Solis & Mare founded by the two Battaglia Brother's, Maxwell and Samuel, opened their restaurant to the public in the spring of 1972. Maxwell and Samuel are both war veterans. Maxwell served in the Army and Samuel served in the Navy. After a long 12 years of service, both Maxwell and Samuel found themselves back home in Charleston, SC craving to share their culinary and business services to the town.

              Solis & Mare got their name based off of the brothers' service to the country. Since the army is a land-based branch, "solis" translates to "the sun" from the latin language. As for "mare" it translates to "the sea", which is how the Navy is represented.

              Solis & Mare is located on the corner of Market Street and S Battery in Charleston, South Carolina which allows its diners to have a beautiful view of the Charleston Battery while eating one of the finest meals of the East Coast (1 of 2 Battaglia brothers: Samuel Battaglia photographed to the right).</p>
